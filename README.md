# Hello

## This is a test repo that i started locally. I have now uploaded it to the remote repo.

I have learnt how to initialize a new repository locally using Command Prompt, stage a file and commit.

Created a new branch.

I have made changes remotely to this read me and now i pulled changes from it.
